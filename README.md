## Reason behind the dataset choice, their related problems
Medical insurance is an important type of insurances for each individual. Understanding the price of insurance based on different factors is significant for both insurance providers and customers. Insurance providers can use the information to adjust their price and sale strategies in order to promote their business. Meanwhile, individual customers can use the information to estimate their insurance price based on their conditions, such that they can select an appropriate insurance plan. This topic is related to both business and healthcare, thus I decided to explore some datasets related to this topic.

After exploration, 2 datasets that are related to medical insurance details in the USA are used for analysis and visualization. The first dataset (insurance.xlsx) describes the individual medical spend on health insurance based on their details including gender, age, BMI, number of children covered by health insurance, whether is a smoker or not and the beneficiary's residential area in the US(in terms of northeast, southeast, southwest and northwest). The second dataset (state.xlsx) describes the health insurance coverage data for each state in the USA, including variables such as the uninsured rates before and after Obamacare, estimates of individuals covered by employer and marketplace healthcare plans, and enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid program. Two datasets are both related to medical insurance in the USA from different points of view: the first one focuses on the cost of insurance and the second one focuses on the coverage rate. From a business owner point of view, understanding both of them is important to make decisions such as target states, plan prices and so on. For a customer, knowing them can help them decide their next step on insurance choice.
